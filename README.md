Machine learning assignment includes several excercises made by me and my collegue:

- Exercise 1: Bayesian inference for the mean of Gaussian distribution
- Exercise 2: Regularized regression
- Exercise 3: Gradient descent
- Exercise 4: Gaussian process and kernels
- Exercise 5: Neural networks

Each exercise includes several questions on deriving formulas, implementing these formulas using Python and plotting the results. We also provide the interpretations of our results.
